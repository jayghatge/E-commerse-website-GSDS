        <p>An ecommerce website is your digital storefront on the internet. 
           It facilitates the transaction between a buyer and seller. 
           It is the virtual space where you showcase products, and online customers make selections. 
           Your website acts as the product shelves, sales staff, and cash register of your online business channel.</p>
           <p>
           An eCommerce website is an online destination where buyers shop for goods and sellers offer products and services. 
           It’s the hub of information about a company and what they sell. On an eCommerce website, you’ll find product listings, eCommerce blog content, company history, and contact information.
           You can sell just about anything through an eCommerce site. 
           Examples include recreational equipment, car and motorcycle parts, household goods, clothing and jewelry, and food and drinks. 
           If you need help coming up with additional ideas, consider these wholesale items to sell or high demand products.
